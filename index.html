            <h2>Performance Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The benchmark results indicate that the custom registry implementation performed marginally better than the standard registry. This performance difference can be attributed to the different concurrency control mechanisms used by the two registries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, the custom registry showed slightly faster performance in write-heavy operations due to the use of fine-grained locking allowing more concurrent access to the registry without significant contention. The ReentrantReadWriteLock permits multiple threads to read a resource concurrently, as long as there are no threads writing to it, and only one thread to write at a time, which provides a balance between read and write operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, the standard registry, which utilizes ConcurrentHashMap, had nearly identical performance, likely because its lock-free read operations provide very fast access for read-heavy operations. ConcurrentHashMap is designed for concurrent access and updates, using a segment-locking mechanism that allows a high degree of concurrency.
            </p>
            <p>
                These insights can guide future optimizations by focusing on enhancing the custom registry's read performance to better leverage the read-write lock's capability for multiple concurrent reads, while maintaining its write performance.
